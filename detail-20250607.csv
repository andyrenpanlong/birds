https://ebird.org/species/audshe,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Sargasso Shearwater,Puffinus lherminieri,,"Small black-and-white shearwater with relatively long tail and somewhat rounded wings. Usually flies low to the water with fluttering wingbeats, but in strong winds it can fly with high wheeling arcs. Undertail coverts are typically dark, but this can be very difficult to see in the field. Compare with Manx Shearwater, which is larger with longer, more pointed wings, light undertail coverts, and a darker face. Found over warm tropical waters, especially around floating mats of Sargassum weed. Often seen singly or in pairs but can gather in loose flocks, sometimes loafing with other shearwater species."
https://ebird.org/species/bakind1,Passeriformes,Viduidae,Barka Indigobird,Vidua larvaticola,,"A nest parasite that lays its eggs in the nests of Black-faced Firefinch. Breeding males are glossy black with blue or blue-green iridescence and a pale brownish panel in the wings. Females and non-breeding males are brown and streaky on the back and pale below, with a bold facial pattern. The bill is white and the legs pinkish. Found in woodland, grassland, and thickets, often near water. Breeding males can be identified with care by their vocalizations and by their blue or blue-green gloss. Non-breeding males and females cannot be separated visually from other indigobirds. Imitates the vocalizations of its host firefinches, including soft, repeated whistles."
https://ebird.org/species/balmal2,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Gola Malimbe,Malimbus ballmanni,,"A striking black-and-yellow malimbe; the female lacks the yellow nape of the male. Juvenile has a pale bill and yellow on the crown and chin. A scarce and patchily distributed endemic resident of Upper Guinea, preferring the middle levels and canopy of tall primary and secondary lowland forest. Joins flocks, often with other malimbes, and gleans leaves and thin twigs looking for insects in the manner of a tit. Vocalizations are poorly known but include varied swizzling and chittering notes. Other malimbes in range have red rather than yellow highlights in their black plumage."
https://ebird.org/species/baseag1,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Western Banded Snake-Eagle,Circaetus cinerascens,,"Chunky, dark brown raptor with barred underparts. Shows a single broad white band through the tail which is conspicuous in flight. Found in and around forest and thick woodland, often near water. Sits for long periods and doesn’t often soar. Generally scarce and uncommon across its range. Call is a weird, strangled “whaaat-hooooa.” Very similar to Fasciated Snake-Eagle, but doesn’t overlap in range. Somewhat similar to African Cuckoo-Hawk, but larger and chunkier, with a dark brown rather than gray head."
https://ebird.org/species/brnowl,Strigiformes,Tytonidae,American Barn Owl,Tyto furcata,,"Medium-sized owl with a heart-shaped facial disc and deep dark eyes; the only Tyto owl present across most of its range; on Hispaniola compare to Ashy-faced Owl. Varies across a wide range, but always note white-and-black speckling on the upperparts, beautiful gray-and-tawny wings, and large round head. Color of the facial disc and underparts varies from pure white to rusty orange. Hunts in open areas by night, foraging with a slow and buoyant flight. Roosts in old buildings, tree hollows, caves, and nest boxes by day. Gives a bone-chilling, rising shriek, as well as shorter rasping calls and insect-like clicks."

Juveniles are grayish-brown above and cinnamon below, with white on face, throat, and neck. Singles and pairs frequent mixed-species flocks within understory of forest, forest edge, and mangroves. Lacks orange on breast, unlike Spectacled Monarch. Song is a high-pitched, descending whistled “seeeer.” Also gives a scratchy “k’schrrrr,” “schrrrr,” and rasping “weeee.”"
https://ebird.org/species/blbpar1,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Black-billed Amazon,Amazona agilis,,"A chunky green inhabitant of wet forests; typically found in pairs or small flocks in or near the canopy. Note this species’ nearly all green plumage, black bill, black eye, and black eyering. The somewhat similar Yellow-billed Parrot is distinguished from Black-billed Parrot by its rose-colored throat, yellow bill, and pale eyering. When the two species are together, the larger size of the Yellow-billed is evident. The characteristics noted above also separate this species from other parrots that might have escaped from captivity. Calls include a harsh “mwah,” a scratchy “uh-lee,” and “uh-luh,” with the latter often given rapidly and while flying."

Pairs often join mixed-species flocks actively hopping along branches, occasionally hanging like mini-nuthatches, searching for invertebrates, and occasionally eating plant matter. Occupies broadleaf woodland, savanna, and arid scrub, where it is often detected by its quiet but distinctive faltering “chree-chirrit, chree-chirrit, chree-chirrit” song. The Red-capped Crombec has paler light gray upperparts and lacks the Cape Crombec’s eye-stripe, giving it a more open tawny face."
https://ebird.org/species/y00415,Passeriformes,Alaudidae,Cape Long-billed Lark,Certhilauda curvirostris,,"A large, slender lark with a long, thin decurved bill and long legs. Features can be variable, but generally this species has streaked gray-brown upperparts and a heavily streaked chest extending onto the flanks. As the similar-looking long-billed larks have separate ranges, location is a key factor in identification, but this is the largest and longest-billed member of the complex. It strides purposefully through sandy coastal shrubland, running quickly before pausing to dig in the soil or pick at shrubs for invertebrate prey and seeds. In a characteristic display the male flies low to the ground, before flying directly up 10 to 15 meters, and then closing its wings and plummeting toward the ground while typically emitting a two-note “tsit-tseeeoooouuu” whistle, the second note descending; in the north, only the second note is given. These calls and others, like a quavering “cheereee-cheeeoo,” can also be given from the ground. Most co-occurring larks are much smaller and more compact, with smaller bills and shorter legs."

https://ebird.org/species/cashon1,Piciformes,Indicatoridae,Cassin's Honeybird,Prodotiscus insignis,,"A small, upright honeyguide of forest and forest edge, where it forages for insects and flycatches into the open. Plumage is a relatively uniform olive-green to green, with a paler throat, small pale eye arcs, and bright white outer tail feathers that are obvious when flying out for insects. Similar to Green-backed Honeyguide and Wahlberg’s Honeyguide, but differs in range, in its overall greenish coloration including the belly, and in its clean white outer tail feathers. Voice is little known, but apparently gives a buzzy trill in flight that rises and falls in pitch."
https://ebird.org/species/chiger2,Passeriformes,Acanthizidae,Chatham Islands Gerygone,Gerygone albofrontata,,"Small warbler endemic to the Chatham Islands of New Zealand. Note dull olive-brown upperparts and white to yellowish plumage below. Distinctive red eye. Males are larger and have a white forehead, eyebrows, chest, and belly. Females have more subtle coloring. Juveniles have brown eyes and a noticeable yellowish tinge to their underparts. Confined to southern forests and scrub. Forages for insects from tree trunks and leaves. Will come to the ground to forage, often in small family flocks. Listen for loud male song, a repeated 4-note phrase “chi-ch-ch-ch.” Some nests are parasitized by larger Shining Bronze-Cuckoo. Distinguishable from Silvereye by lack of distinctive white eye-ring."

The crown, back of the neck, and back are heavily streaked. Note specific habitat preferences, which can help with identification: found in seepage zones of seasonally wet grasslands, alongside but in wetter situations than Wing-snapping Cisticolas, but avoiding the seasonally flooded habitat of Pale-crowned Cisticola. Very similar to Wing-snapping and Pale-crowned Cisticolas, but longer-tailed than both, and further distinguished from Pale-crowned in breeding plumage by the streaked crown. Also similar to Zitting and Desert Cisticolas, but has a different voice, and is darker on the back. Song consists of nasal notes, given from a low perch (termite mound or grass stem) or occasional brief display flight at grass top height. In contrast to other small cisticolas, it does not have a true aerial display flight."

The long banded tail, brown back with a rufous hind-collar, white breast, and barred flanks make this species unique within its range. Western birds have white throats, while eastern birds have black-spotted throats. Frequently heard calling in the forest, uttering a long series of “HOW, how, HOW, how” caws that are reminiscent of a hornbill. Throughout range, co-occurs with the similar-looking Cassin’s Hawk-Eagle, but Congo Serpent-Eagle is smaller, has a black line down the center of the throat, and appears bigger-headed."

Plumage is gray and brown, lacking yellow tones, with brown wingbars and a pale eye stripe. Round crown and lack of crest help separate it from Southern Beardless-Tyrannulet and Gray-and-white Tyrannulet. Very similar to Marañon Tyrannulet (they were formerly considered to be the same species and called Mouse-colored Tyrannulet). Differences are very subtle, and range is often the best clue. Tumbes Tyrannulet is found primarily in the western lowlands, reaching only into the lower foothills of the Andes. Vocalizations tend to be shorter and more abrupt than those of Marañon Tyrannulet, and include a quick “widichit!” and “peedit!” as well as various sharp squeaks and rasps."

Relatively large and lanky for a white-eye, with a striking orangey-yellow bill immediately distinguishing it from Wakatobi White-eye, the only other white-eye on the island. Also note the pale belly and chest contrasting with the relatively dull yellow upperparts and yellow throat. Found throughout the island in patches of taller and denser forest, although uncommon and already declining due to habitat loss and trapping for the cagebird trade. Gives a variety of calls, including a distinctive nasal series and a stuttered ""tew-tew-tew.""
